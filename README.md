## Business Goal / Case Statement

My goal is to elevate user engagement and retention in social and messaging applications by fine-tuning a transformer-based language model (GPT-2) on a rich dataset of 17,000+ curated conversation prompts. This model will enable the dynamic generation of relevant, high-quality conversation starters—ranging from light and playful to deep and thought-provoking—tailored to the context and interests of users.

This AI-driven conversation engine directly addresses three key challenges faced by social apps:

* **Breaking the Ice Faster**: Reduces the awkwardness of initiating conversations, especially in dating or friend-finding platforms, improving onboarding and first-session engagement.

* **Personalizing Conversations at Scale**: By leveraging tagged prompts and topical filters, the model serves up prompts aligned with user interests and emotional tone, increasing time spent in-app.

* **Enhancing Social Stickiness and Retention**: Consistent access to fresh, engaging conversation content encourages daily interactions and helps develop meaningful user connections—driving higher session frequency and lower churn.

Initially, this model will serve as an embedded feature within new group chats and newly formed direct messages. Long-term, it will function as the foundational layer for an AI-powered conversation assistant integrated across mobile and web apps. This assistant will deliver intelligent prompts in real-time, encouraging authentic connections.
## Assignment Context

**Relevant Industry and/or Business Function:** Fashion / Apparel Design / E-commerce

**Description:**

To enhance conversational engagement across social and messaging platforms, the core task involves fine-tuning the GPT-2 model to generate contextual and tagged conversation starters, enabling:

* Prompt personalization via topic filtering

* Real-time generation of icebreakers, discussion questions, or thought starters

* Low-latency deployment for integration in messaging interfaces

By enabling AI-driven, context-aware conversations, this project empowers product teams to deliver more meaningful, dynamic, and human-like interactions.
